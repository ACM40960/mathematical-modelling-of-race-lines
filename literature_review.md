Through the course of this project we attempt to understand the impact of different forces on a race car, modelled by a system of equations and thereby we attempt to create an optimal race line for a user drawn race track or predefined F1 race tracks.

We attempt to solve the problem of minimum-lap-time and optimal control  for a Formula One race car is solved using direct transcription and nonlinear programming<sup>[1]</sup>.
The objective is to compute an optimal trajectory, control inputs and setup parameters that together yield the fastest lap, while considering the physical and the dynamic constraints of the car and the track, considering dynamic quantities like friction, temperature etc. This enables the optimization of the racing line, driver controls and the car-specific variables like aerodynamic balance, and suspension stiffness.
