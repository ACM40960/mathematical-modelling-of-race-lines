# Researching on ideas that we discussed on 14/05/2025

## Video indexing/searching with the help of AI

The videos are not time stamped by the uploader(as seen on youtube) AI learns the context of the video and saves some info about a particialr frame so that when a user searches for something the AI can then fetch the indexed hash that matched the search description and shows the time stamp from where in the video a particular scene actually starts or the info the user has asked starts.
e.g User types - Slow motion video of a man shooting prince Rupert's drop
results - smartereveryday channel's video on prince Rupert's drop

*How will this learn context from a video* - need to look into researches that are being done on this to see if there are papers written on extracting context from a video maybe going frame by frame or processing the whole video at one go.


## Weather pattern modelling to predict next 15-20 days of weather and suggest optimized routes for high priority goods(grains, food raw materians, medical equipments, drugs) to be imported/exported via air or water in such a way that it takes less time and fuel(inter continental logistics)

Weather pattern changes as told by James in his class for uncertainty quantification are very chaotic and unpredictable, so we will tackle that (doesn't need to be super accurate just enough to predict with good accuracy for the future)

With this done let us say Fedex wants to deliver a package from Dublin to India in optimal time with optimal route.
What we suggest from the weather pattern changes are what routes will be optimal(just like Google maps does on a local level) but we suggest travel time by air, sea

https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/ - The Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) is a global network of researchers and policy makers conducting quantitative analysis of international policy issues. GTAP is coordinated by the Center for Global Trade Analysis in Purdue University's Department of Agricultural Economics.
The database is not free, we need to look into other data sources

https://leung-lab.github.io/leunglab/articles/Sardain_et_al_Nature_Sust_2019.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com - Socioeconomic factors, including population growth, global trade and the worldwide transport of materials, interact with  environmental drivers to determine the sustainability of natural systems. We focus on the global shipping network, which is central to invasive species spread worldwide. We explain 90% of the variation in global shipping traffic and a twofold increase in shipping using basic socioeconomic indicators and a temporal validation set. Combining our model with global economic development scenarios, we project global maritime traffic to increase by 240â€“1,209% by 2050. Integrating our predictions with global climate change projections and shipping-mediated invasion models, we forecast invasion risk to surge in middle-income countries, particularly in Northeast Asia. Shipping growth will have a far greater effect on marine invasions than climate-driven environmental changes: while climate change might actually decrease the average probability of invasion, the emerging global shipping network could yield a 3- to 20-fold increase in global invasion risk.

This one has various  data  sources and the results of their model that they ran
